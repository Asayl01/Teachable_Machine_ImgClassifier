# Teachable Machine Image Classifier

## Project Description  
This is a simple image classification project to recognize different types of drones — including fixed-wing, fixed-wing VTOL, multi-rotor, and single-rotor helicopter drones — using a machine learning model trained with Teachable Machine.

## Tools Used  
- **Teachable Machine** for training the image recognition model.  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** to export and run the model in Python.  
- **Google Colab** for testing and running the classification script.

##  What is Teachable Machine?  
[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool by Google that lets you train machine learning models without writing any code.
